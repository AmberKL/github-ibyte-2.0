                        Hi, my name is Amber. I am self-taught in a lot of things.
                        I have been working on the other side of the tech world as a recruiter for the past year, 
                        and now I am trying to be a part of the creation of software solutions. I am excited to 
                        show you some of my projects below! Welcome to my portfolio!

                    <p class="aboutweather">
                        This was my first project towards my portfolio. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to 
                        make this work. I chose some neutral colours for design. This was my first time working 
                        with API's - it was certainly rewarding to see it all work! I'd love to develop this into my own
                        weather app and develop more features, so more updates are to come!

                    <p class="abouttodo">
                        This task was a very simple to-do-list. I enjoyed doing this project because again, 
                        it was very satisfying seeing the results of the javasscript code, and how it interacts with HTML/CSS elements.
                        As you can see, users can add tasks, highlight their importance and delete once complete! I'm pretty proud 
                        of how simple I was able to make the JavaScript in this code.

                    <a class="projectheader4" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AmberKL/Translator">Language Translator</a>
                    <div class="itranslatec"><img class="imgtranslate" src="images/Translator.png"></div>
                    <p class="abouttranslator">
                        I love languages, but deciding which one to stick to is the hardest part. I find
                        myself wanting to learn every language I can - this also includes programming languages.
                        <br><br>I wanted to have a go at creating my own translator. Again, it was really exciting to see 
                        the effects of my code, and how the HTML, CSS and JavaScript interact to 
                        translate into totally different languages - even the punctuation as shown above!
                        <br><br>I'm hoping to develop this project into an app where users can create their own flashcards 
                        using this translator to learn langugaes in their own way.
